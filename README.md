This project required that I follow predefined user stories. This was an opportunity to not only practice adherence to client specifications, it was also great to practice:

- Accessibility by using alt tags, legible fonts, and responsive relative-sized typography.

- The command line, including the essential git workflow and developing more comprehensive git commit messages

- Responsive imagery by using media queries to alter div padding
